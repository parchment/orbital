# Orbital ðŸ’«

A web-based visualization of our solar system built with plain HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. The project aims to create both idealized and accurate representations of planetary motions, with interactive features for exploration and education.

## Current State

Version 0.2.0 implements:
- Refactored codebase for better mode switching and configuration
- Centralized configuration system for different view modes
- Proper astronomical time scaling
- Separate visual and time controls
- Enhanced planet property management
- Groundwork for elliptical orbits with eccentricity values
- All inner planets (Mercury through Mars)
- Mode toggle between simple and realistic views
