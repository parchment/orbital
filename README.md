# Orbital ðŸ’«

A web-based visualization of our solar system built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to create both idealized and accurate representations of planetary motions, with interactive features for exploration and education. The visualization uses time scaling optimized for visual clarity rather than astronomical accuracy, allowing users to observe planetary motions at comfortable speeds while maintaining correct relative orbital periods.

## Current State

Version 0.3.0 implements:
- Modular architecture with separated concerns
- Interactive time control slider for orbit speed adjustment
- Visualization-focused time scaling (4 minutes to 12 seconds per Earth orbit)
- Linear speed progression for intuitive control
- Time display in minutes/seconds per orbit
- Smooth transitions between view modes with coordinated animations
- Centralized configuration system for different view modes
- Enhanced planet property management
- Accurate Keplerian orbital motion
- Precise elliptical orbit visualization with SVG paths
- All inner planets (Mercury through Mars)
- Mode toggle between simple and realistic views
- True relative sizing of planets in realistic mode
- Accurate orbital distances (scaled by AU) in realistic mode
- Interactive zoom control for realistic mode
- Consistent centered positioning in both modes
